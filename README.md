# DaftPunkGenerator

This repo serves to outline a learning experience
with Deep Learing. Started with a simple WaveNet CNN
to analyze and generate single piano classical music.
Making this model better and eventually
have a model that can analyze multiple instruments and
generate music with multiple instruments. The goal is to
have the model train on Daft Punk's Music and have it
generate very daft and punky music.
